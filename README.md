## üöÄ Features

- **Book Management API:**
    - Add, update, delete, search, and retrieve book details.
- **Middleware Support:**
    - Logging, request validation, and user action tracking.
- **Elasticsearch Integration:**
    - Indexing and querying books with custom mappings.
- **Redis Integration:**
    - Buffering and caching for improved performance.
- **Modular Design:**
    - Organized packages with clear separation of concerns.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Go** (>= 1.17)
- **Docker** (for running Elasticsearch and Redis locally)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/moshe-mizrachi/book_service.git
   cd book_service

2. Install Dep
    ```bash
    go mod tidy
    ```
3. Run the app
    ```bash
    go run cmd/main/main.go
    ```

### üîë Environment Variables
Define the following variables in a .env or .env.test file:

| Variable  | Description                      | Default               |
|-----------|----------------------------------|-----------------------|
| PORT      | Port for the application server  | 8080                 |
| ELS_URI   | Elasticsearch connection URI     | http://localhost:9200 |
| REDIS_URI | Redis connection URI             | localhost:6379        |

### üìñ API Endpoints
Books API (/v1/books)

| Method    | Endpoint       | Description                  |
|-----------|----------------|------------------------------|
| `POST`    | `/v1/books/`   | Add a new book              |
| `GET`     | `/v1/books/:id`| Retrieve book details by ID |
| `PUT`     | `/v1/books/:id`| Update book title by ID     |
| `DELETE`  | `/v1/books/:id`| Delete a book by ID         |
| `GET`     | `/v1/books/search` | Search for books          |


### Middlewares

```go
// Logger Middleware
Logs details of incoming requests, including:
- HTTP method
- Request path
- Status code
- Latency
- User agent

// Validation Middleware
Validates incoming requests against defined schemas using Gin's binding and validation mechanisms.

// RecordActions Middleware
Tracks user actions such as method, path, and time, and stores them in Redis for auditing purposes.
```


### Query Builder
The query builder lets you play and construct the wanted query according to your needs

```go
// Query Builder Methods
qb := query.NewQueryBuilder()

// Add an ID filter to the query
qb.ID("12345")

// Add a title filter to the query
qb.Title("Book Title")

// Add an author name filter to the query
qb.AuthorName("Author Name")

// Add a price range filter to the query
qb.PriceRange(10, 50)

// Build the final query
result := qb.Build()

// Output Example:
{
  "query": {
    "bool": {
      "must": [
        {"term": {"_id": "12345"}},
        {"match": {"title": "Book Title"}}
      ],
      "filter": [
        {"range": {"price": {"gte": 10, "lte": 50}}}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### üß™ Testing
#### Run Tests
To run the tests:
